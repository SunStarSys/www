## ezmlm-idx

My experience with mailing list software revolves around [qmail](http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html) and [ezmlm-idx](http://untroubled.org/ezmlm/). With a few small scripts, I was able to support a wide variety of new use cases not inherently supported by `ezmlm-idx` itself.  The features that are generically useful outside of [The Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org) are laid out below.  To use these files follow this [layout](ezmlm/) unless you are comfortable adjusting the paths in the scripts yourself.

### BATV and SRS

[bin/sender-demunger](ezmlm/bin/sender-demunger.pl) is a little wrapper script that enables `BATV` and `SRS` `SENDER` demunging for `ezmlm-idx`.  To use it you simply add it as a prefix to all of the lines in your `</editor/>` and `</manager/>` blocks within `.ezmlmrc` and run `ezmlm-make -+` on your lists, or in a pinch assuming you will not run `ezmlm-make` again on your lists, edit the `editor` and `manager` files within your list directories.

[BATV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_Address_Tag_Validation) and [SRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Rewriting_Scheme) pose unique problems for `ezmlm-idx` because unlike other mailing list software it operates on the `MAIL FROM` portion of the `SMTP` envelope, not the "From" address in the message headers.

Both specifications revolve around providing temporary addresses to the `MAIL FROM` envelope portion, which embed the original address in an easily decipherable way.  But <!-- #teaser -->these temporary addresses are anathema to `ezmlm-idx`'s subscription and moderation systems<!-- #teaser -->, and the `sender-demunger.pl` script mentioned above will fix that once deployed.

According to the release notes, since version 7.0.0, ezmlm-idx should have support for BATV and SRS built in. In any case sender-demunger really won't hurt just in case :-).

### DMARC

See [bin/ezmlm-dmarc-filter.pl](ezmlm/bin/ezmlm-dmarc-filter.pl) and [bin/ezmlm-seekable-stdin.pl](ezmlm/bin/ezmlm-seekable-stdin.pl) and [lib/pull_header.pm](ezmlm/lib/pull_header.pm).  To use these scripts, change the lines in your `</editor/>` section of `.ezmlmrc` that call `ezmlm-gate`, `ezmlm-store`, or `ezmlm-send`, to look like the following:

```shell
    |/path/to/bin/ezmlm-dmarc-filter.pl '<#D#>/dmarc' | /path/to/bin/ezmlm-seekable-stdin.pl /path/to/bin/sender-demunger.pl <#B#>/ezmlm-gate -rY '<#D#>' '<#D#>' '<#D#>/digest' '<#D#>/allow' '<#D#>/mod'
    |/path/to/bin/ezmlm-dmarc-filter.pl '<#D#>/dmarc' | /path/to/bin/sender-demunger.pl <#B#>/ezmlm-store '<#D#>'
    |/path/to/bin/ezmlm-dmarc-filter.pl '<#D#>/dmarc' | <#B#>/ezmlm-send -r '<#D#>'
```

This assumes you will touch a file named `dmarc` in any list directories where you want to enable the filter.  You can configure `.ezmlmrc` to do this by adding the following block to that file:

```shell
	</-dmarc#FXT/>
	</dmarc#f/>
	</dmarc#t/>
	</dmarc#x/>
```
The only list configurations that run afoul of `DMARC` are those with `-f`, `-t` or `-x` set. The above configuration will adjust for that.

In case you haven't kept up with the times, there is a recent movement afoot to introduce strong [DMARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) policies that reject messages which fail [DKIM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) signature tests. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo! and now AOL have been leading this charge into new territory, forcing mailing list operators to deal with the situation. What the `ezmlm-dmarc-filter.pl` does, and this isn't the only possible solution to the problem, is drop the `DKIM-Signature` header for any such domain, and add an `.INVALID` suffix to the sender's `From` header address.  It has the advantage of being one of the simplest solutions that works, so I'm offering it here.  So far the domains that deploy strict `DMARC` policies all provide appropriate `Reply-To` headers, so these changes made by `ezmlm-dmarc-filter.pl` will not impact the operation of any RFC-compliant email responses to such messages.
